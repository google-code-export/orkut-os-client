Orkut Client Library
--------------------

The orkut client library allows access to read and update orkut's social data. The client library is "experimental" at present and may change in the future.
You can download the latest version of the client library from http://code.google.com/p/orkut-os-client/
Checkout the latest javadoc for this project at http://orkut-os-client.googlecode.com/hg/java/doc


Requirements
------------
* ant
  If typing ant on the command-line throws errors, try:
  sudo apt-get install ant  # (on debian systems)
  or get the latest version of ant from http://ant.apache.org/
* java development kit (JDK)
  This library has been built and run on Java 1.5 (J2SE 5.0) and
  on Java 1.6 (JDK 6). YMMV across different Java versions. You can
  get the latest and greatest versions of JDK from http://java.sun.com/

Steps to Build
--------------
  # (Only if you don't have ant)
  sudo apt-get install ant

  cd java/
  ant

  make sure there are no build error.s

Steps to run sample app
-----------------------
  cd java/ # if you're not in java/ already from the build steps
  ant run-sample

  The sample app should open a browser window where it'll ask your permission
  to allow access to orkut data. Following this, the sample app with request
  and print a list of orkut friends.

Where to get oauth keys?
------------------------
http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/RegistrationForWebAppsAuto.html#new

Once you register your site you will get a consumer key and a consumer secret.
The consumer key is usually your site url, e.g. "my.site.com", while the
consume secret is a cryptographically secure random string e.g. "Masdsadl213mzza0Y/l"

Where to configure those keys for the samples?
----------------------------------------------
  The oauth related details are stored in file java/sample/oauth.properties

  Edit the file and enter the consumer key and secret in there. Leave everything
  else untouched.

  consumerSecret=<your-app-consumer-secret>
  consumerKey=<your-app-consumer-key>

  Now if you run the samples again it should use your applications credentials.

More sample apps
----------------
Take a look at code in java/sample/sample-src/com/google/orkut/client/sample/

Note: For the moment, you need to be whitelisted to run the sample apps.
Go to http://code.google.com/p/orkut-os-client/ for more info. You may run the
other samples after updating java/sample/oauth.properties by:
  ant run-all-samples

Building Documentation
----------------------

In java/ directory, issue the command

  ant javadoc

Documentation will be generated in java/doc.

Building the client library jar
-------------------------------

In java/ directory, issue the command

  ant dist

This builds the client library in java/dist/lib/.

Enjoy!
