Orkut Client Library
--------------------

The orkut client library allows access to read and update orkut's social data.
The client library is "experimental" at present and may change in the future.
You can download the latest version of the client library from http://code.google.com/p/orkut-os-client/
Checkout the latest javadoc for this project at http://orkut-os-client.googlecode.com/hg/java/doc


1. Requirements
---------------
* ant
  If typing ant on the command-line throws errors, try:
  sudo apt-get install ant  # (on debian systems)
  or get the latest version of ant from http://ant.apache.org/
* java development kit (JDK)
  This library has been built and run on Java 1.5 (J2SE 5.0) and
  on Java 1.6 (JDK 6). YMMV across different Java versions. You can
  get the latest and greatest versions of JDK from http://java.sun.com/

2. Steps to Build
------------------
  # (Only if you don't have ant)
  sudo apt-get install ant

  cd java/
  ant

  make sure there are no build error.s

3. Get OAuth keys for your app 
------------------------------
  Before you can start using the API or run the sample given here, you need 
  to get OAuth consumer key and secret. Please visit the following URL for
  instruction on registring your app and getting a oauth consumer key and
  secret.

  http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/RegistrationForWebAppsAuto.html#new

  The consumer key is usually your site url, e.g. "my.site.com", while the
  consume secret is a cryptographically secure random string e.g. "Masdsadl213mzza0Y/l"

4. Install the keys for use by sample app 
-----------------------------------------
  The oauth related details are stored in file java/sample/oauth.properties

  Edit the file and enter the consumer key and secret in there. Leave everything
  else untouched.

  consumerSecret=<your-app-consumer-secret>
  consumerKey=<your-app-consumer-key>

  to test if your keys are valid, and every thing is fine run the following
  command from your console.

  cd java/
  ant test-auth

  This would open an OAuth flow, by opening a browser window. Once you are through
  that flow, you should see this messsage on the consule.

  "*** Authentication PASSED ***"

  If you see that then you are ready to run other samples. On the other hand, if
  you see a stack trace, or some other error message, then 3-legged oauth
  authentication failed.

5. Steps to run sample app
--------------------------
  Before you can start using the sample, you need to get oauth consumer key & secret.
  See section 3 & 4 on how to get those keys for your app and how to install it.

  After you have installed the keys,

  cd java/
  ant run-sample

  The sample app should open a browser window where it'll ask your permission
  to allow access to orkut data. Following this, the sample app with request
  and print a list of orkut friends.

6. More sample apps
-------------------
  Take a look at code in java/sample/sample-src/com/google/orkut/client/sample/

Note: For the moment, you need to be whitelisted to run the sample apps.
Go to http://code.google.com/p/orkut-os-client/ for more info. You may run the
other samples after updating java/sample/oauth.properties by:
  ant run-all-samples

7. Building Documentation
-------------------------

In java/ directory, issue the command

  ant javadoc

Documentation will be generated in java/doc.

8. Building the client library jar
----------------------------------

In java/ directory, issue the command

  ant dist

This builds the client library in java/dist/lib/.

Enjoy!
