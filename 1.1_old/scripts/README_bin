--USAGE--
---------

This release is an easy-build binary JAR that you can add directly to your
java project and use. It is different from the regular orkut-os-client
release, which contains source code and samples.

Therefore, if you are looking for the library's source code or samples,
this is the wrong archive: please check the project's page.

To use this release, simply include the JAR file into your project.
Check Sample.java in the samples/ directory for an example application.
