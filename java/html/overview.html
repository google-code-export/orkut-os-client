    The <a href="http://orkut.com">orkut</a> client library allows access to read and update <a href="http://orkut.com">orkut</a>'s social data. The client library is "experimental" at present and may change in the future. You can download the latest version of the client library <a href="http://code.google.com/p/orkut-os-client/">here</a>.

    The Orkut Client Library API is broadly divided into the following classes:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Data Models</b>: These are java objects that represent content fetched from orkut. With an interface much like java-beans, they make it easy for a developer to access orkut's data.
        eg. see {@link com.google.orkut.client.api.OrkutPerson}, which represents a person's data on orkut</li>
      <li><b>Transactions</b>: These are individual operations which execute to produce a desired effect
        - like fetching information about a user ({@link com.google.orkut.client.api.GetProfileTx}) or updating a user's profile ({@link com.google.orkut.client.api.UpdateProfileTx})
      </li>
      <li><b>Transaction Factories</b>: All transactions are generated through transaction factories. Transaction factories usually provide a means to generate related transactions.
        eg. An Albums Transaction factory ({@link com.google.orkut.client.api.AlbumsTxFactory}) gives all transactions to create / delete / update and fetch albums.
      </li>
      <li><b>Batch Transaction and common constants</b>: A {@link com.google.orkut.client.api.BatchTransaction} collates multiple transactions as one transaction are provides a single request which can be sent to the orkut server.
        Common constants used in forming requests and understanding responses are in {@link com.google.orkut.client.api.Constants}</li>
    </ul>
